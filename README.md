# Photoshop-Clone
Images are just not a digital representation of an object or a person. It can be a proof of evidence for some, memory for many or also a representation of art for the rest. 
Photo editing can be a way of getting a second chance to get the image the way you would have wanted to capture it in-camera. So, there is always a need to create pro-quality photos by enhancing its properties. Thus, is the need for image filters and image enhancing techniques such as increasing an image’s sharpness, altering its brightness etc.  
This photoshop clone project provides functions that help improve and enhance the properties of an image you upload and save the edited images locally to the users pc.  

## Methodology :
The project is implemented in Python Programming Language. 
•	The PIL (Python Imaging Library), is an original library used in Python to deal with images and is mainly being used in this project. 
•	It incorporates lightweight image processing tools that aids in editing, creating and saving images. 
•	Pillow supports a large number of image file formats including BMP, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF. This library provides an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities. 

## Outcomes :
The user can select a list of options to view the properties of an image, various editing options such as (cropping an image, resizing the image, altering its brightness and sharpness, blurring the image), or even adding various image filters to an image such as (the grey scale filter, rainbow scale filter, image border, mirror images, rainbow image filter) etc.
